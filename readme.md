### Description: 
 Prepair allows users to select from a range of home improvement projects, like building a cabinet, input desired dimensions on that piece of furniture, select stain or paint colors, with options to select “tools I have at home” and will return a cost estimate for all materials needed to complete the project. Alongside material list, pricing, and a diagram, the app will also return a DIY instruction video for that project (in future development).
